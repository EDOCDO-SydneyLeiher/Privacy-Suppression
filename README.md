## Background

Privacy suppression techniques are utilized to prevent reidentification and protect individuals' privacy when dealing with cell counts equal to or less than three. In this project we have applied a primary and complementary suppresion. We have applied a minimum N-size of 3 to group size for EPP enrollment as a primary suppression. Complementary suppression is applied when a group has its data masked because another group doesn’t meet the N-size of 3, and the first group’s results could be determined through simple calculations.
